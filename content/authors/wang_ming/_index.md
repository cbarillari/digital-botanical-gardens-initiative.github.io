Dr. Wang received his BS summa cum laude in computer engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign. He earned his PhD with Prof. Nuno Bandeira in Computer Science at the University of California San Diego. Dr. Wang then turned to chemistry and pharmaceutical sciences in his postdoctoral studies with Prof. Pieter C. Dorrestein in the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of California San Diego. Dr. Wang is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of California Riverside. Dr. Wang is keenly interested in how computational approaches in analyzing mass spectrometry data can gain insight into the chemical world around us. Dr. Wang’s work has created computational tools that enable global visualization of unknown chemistry that makes it possible to rapidly discover new molecules. Dr. Wang has scaled these approaches mine repository scale data across all public metabolomics and natural products data that include billions of unknown molecules. Dr. Wang has led the development of computational tools and infrastructure that resulted in the GNPS ecosystem – a web analysis and knowledge curation infrastructure that became the de facto standard tool for the natural products, metabolomics, and chemical ecology research communities. His computational tools are used by thousands of chemists and biologists from around the world each month. Dr. Wang co-founded Ometa Labs in 2017 that commercialized the computational tools he developed during his PhD and postdoctoral studies.  Dr. Wang’s research interests lie in bioinformatics, computational mass spectrometry, and analytical chemistry.
